    "**Chapter 1, The World’s Smallest Django Project**\n",
    "- Creating lightweight and simple web applications is the core concept in this book. In this chapter, you’ll be building a runnable, single-file “Hello World” Django application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 2, Stateless Web Application**\n",
    "- Ever wonder how placeholder image services are created? Chapter 2 walks you through how to build a stateless web application to generate placeholder image URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 3, Building a Static Site Generator**\n",
    "- Rapid prototyping is a useful technique for creating and scaffolding web applica‐ tions. We’ll review the purposes of this technique by creating a static site generator to help scaffold your team’s project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 4, Building a REST API**\n",
    "- REST APIs are an important part of creating web applications with rich and relevant content. This is the chapter in which we start building out a large-scale Scrum board application by using the django-rest-framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 5, Client-Side Django with Backbone.js**\n",
    "- Chapter 5 continues with what we built in Chapter 4 by walking you through cre‐ ating a Backbone.js application that works with our newly made RESTful API. We’ll touch on each component that creates a new Backbone application and how to sync up this client-side framework with Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 6, Single-Page Web Application**\n",
    "- Single-page web applications are a way in which we can create enriching client-side web applications. In this chapter we’ll return to our simple Backbone application and continue our progress by making it a robust single-page application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 7, Real-Time Django**\n",
    "- Creating web applications that respond to interactions in real time provides instant gratification for our users. To complete our project from the previous two chapters, we’ll add a real-time component to our Scrum board using websockets and Tornado, an asynchronous networking library written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 8, Communication Between Django and Tornado**\n",
    "- Connecting the power of Django to the robust behaviors of Tornado is an important measure in creating scalable, real-time Django applications. In this chapter, we’ll expand on our usage of the Tornado server by integrating the ability to work with Django to create a secure and interactive relationship."

A developer experienced doing DOM manipulation and making AJAX calls with jQuery should be able to follow the examples using Backbone.js. If you are familiar with another client-side framework such as Angular.js, Ember.js, or Knockout.js, you will be ahead of the game.\n",

    "    - Redis\n",
    "        - is an open source key/value cache. This book makes use of the pub/sub features of Redis and requires 2.0 and higher."
